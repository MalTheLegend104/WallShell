# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to WallShell! Your contributions, no matter how small, are incredibly valuable to the project's growth and improvement.

WallShell is a relatively small codebase, and any help is always appreciated. If you see something you want to implement or fix, here's how you can contribute:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Implement your changes or fixes in your fork.
3. Create a pull request to submit your changes back to the main repository.

While a full contribution guide and code styling guide will be added in the future, it's not our top priority at the moment.

> Please note that the repo owner reserves all rights to deny a pull request for any reason. This isn't meant to be intimidating; rather, it's to ensure that all contributions align with the project's goals and standards.
> If you have an idea for a feature, it's a good idea to create an issue and mention that you'd like to implement it. This way, you'll get feedback on it before you spend time implementing it.
> If your pull request is denied for code quality or code styling issues, simply fix them and create another pull request.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to WallShell, it's truly appreciated!
